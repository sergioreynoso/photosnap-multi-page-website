## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js 13 (App directory)](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - For animations
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) - An open source component library optimized for fast development and accessibility

### What I learned

- How to work with Next.js 13 new [app router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app).
- How to optimize images for different view ports using Next.js Image component.
- Orchestrate animations with Framer Motion, including how to use the [Animate Presence](https://www.framer.com/motion/animate-presence/) component and [layout animations](https://www.framer.com/motion/component/##layout-animation).
- Build an accessible and responsive data table.

### Continued development

Currently all images are loaded statically. I would like to explore using a service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to enhance website speed, UX, and SEO through dynamic image handling, optimization, responsive delivery, and global CDN. It streamlines development, offers backup, analytics, and cost savings, making it a valuable upgrade over static image loading.
